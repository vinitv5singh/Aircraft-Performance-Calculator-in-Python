# Aircraft-Performance-Calculator-in-Python
This Python-based Aircraft Performance Calculator provides tools for analyzing and calculating key performance metrics of aircraft. It includes features to compute takeoff distances, fuel consumption, climb rates, range, and endurance, using various performance equations and models.

Objectives
1.Create a Python program to calculate aircraft performance metrics based on user input.
2.Incorporate formulas for range, endurance, fuel consumption, and climb performance.
3.Allow users to specify aircraft characteristics such as weight, wing area, and engine thrust.
4.Provide graphical outputs and analysis of performance trade-offs.
